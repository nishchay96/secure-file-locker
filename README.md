A sophisticated multi-tier security application that protects your files with time-based authentication, system biometrics, and physical key verification. Think of it as a digital fortress for your most sensitive files.

## 🌟 What Makes This Unique?

### Three-Layer Security Architecture

| Vault Level | Authentication Method | Use Case |
|-------------|----------------------|----------|
| **🛡️ Vault 1** | Time-based passwords | Daily sensitive documents |
| **🛡️🛡️ Vault 2** | Time + System factors (CPU, RAM, Battery) | Financial records, important work files |
| **🛡️🛡️🛡️ Vault 3** | Time + Physical keys (USB/Bluetooth) | Legal documents, personal secrets, crypto keys |

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔐 Advanced Encryption
- **Military-grade AES-128 encryption** using Fernet
- Each file encrypted with unique keys
- Secure key storage in encrypted database

### ⏰ Smart Time-Based Authentication
```python
# Example: HDMY format = HourDayMonthYear
# 2:30 PM on Dec 25, 2024 → "14302512"
Password = Hour(14) + Day(25) + Month(12) + Year(2024)
```

### 🔧 System Integration
- **Battery percentage** monitoring
- **CPU usage** patterns
- **RAM size** verification
- Real-time system state analysis

### 🔌 Physical Key Support
- **USB Drive Tokens** - Encrypted key files on removable drives
- **Bluetooth Device Pairing** - Phone/watch presence detection
- **Multi-factor authentication** - Something you have + something you know

### 📁 Comprehensive File Management
- **File & Folder encryption**
- **Application locking** (Windows EXE files)
- **Secure transfer** between vaults
- **One-click restoration** with conflict resolution

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure-file-locker.git
cd secure-file-locker

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Launch the application
python ui.py
```

### First-Time Setup
1. **Configure Vault 1** - Choose your time format (HDMY, MDHY, etc.)
2. **Setup Vault 2** - Add system factors and timezone
3. **Activate Vault 3** - Connect USB drive or Bluetooth device
4. **Start securing files** - Drag and drop files into your vaults

## 🎯 Real-World Usage Examples

### Personal Use
- **Password databases** - Keep your KeePass files in Vault 3
- **Tax documents** - Store in Vault 2 with system verification
- **Personal photos** - Quick access with Vault 1 time codes

### Business Use
- **Client contracts** - Vault 3 with USB key requirement
- **Financial reports** - Vault 2 with additional security factors
- **Employee documents** - Vault 1 for daily access

### Developer Use
- **SSH keys** - Maximum protection in Vault 3
- **API credentials** - Vault 2 with system validation
- **Configuration files** - Vault 1 for regular access

## 🔍 How It Works

### Security Architecture
```
User File → Encryption (AES-128) → Secure Storage
           ↳ Unique Key Generation
           ↳ Hash Verification
           ↳ Audit Logging
```

### Authentication Flow
```
Vault 1: Current Time → Format Pattern → Password
Vault 2: Time + System Factors → Combined Password  
Vault 3: Time + Physical Key Presence → Access Granted
```

## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Basic File Protection
```python
# Lock a file to Vault 1
backend.lock_file("secret_document.pdf", vault_level=1)

# Unlock when needed  
backend.unlock_file(item_id)
```

### Advanced Security Setup
```python
# Vault 2 with battery + CPU factors
config = {
    'format': 'HDMY',
    'timezone': 'America/New_York', 
    'additional_factors': ['battery', 'cpu']
}
backend.save_vault_config(2, config)
```

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### Cross-Vault Transfers
```python
# Move files between security levels
backend.transfer_items_between_vaults([item_ids], target_vault=3)
```

### Physical Key Management
```python
# Create USB key
backend.create_usb_key_on_drive("E:\\")

# Verify Bluetooth device
backend.verify_bluetooth_key(vault_level=3)
```
